This model was followed by a brief production run of second-generation cars, under model code KPGC110, in 1973.The GF-BNR34 (R34) Skyline GT-R, GT-R V·Spec and GT-R V·Spec N1 models were introduced in January 1999. The R34 GT-R was shorter (from front to rear), and the front overhang was reduced as compared to its predecessor. The valve covers were painted glossy red , as opposed to black in previous models.
